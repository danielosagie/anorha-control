feat: Add passive recording for real-world trajectory data collection

Add passive_recorder.py module that captures mouse movements and clicks
during normal computer use, converting them into TRM training data without
requiring synthetic task execution.

Features:
- Background recording using pynput.mouse.Listener
- Position buffering at ~60Hz (configurable via --min-interval-ms)
- Trajectory segmentation from last click to current click
- Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise while preserving shape
- Quality filtering (discards trajectories with excessive direction reversals)
- Optional screenshot capture for Vision TRM training
- Outputs TrajectoryData format compatible with existing training pipeline

Benefits:
- Collect hundreds to thousands of trajectories from days of normal use
- More diverse, human-like movement patterns than synthetic easing curves
- Zero effort - runs in background while user works normally
- Complements VLM-guided data gathering for better trajectory diversity

Usage:
  uv run python -m anorha_control.exploration.passive_recorder
  uv run python -m anorha_control.exploration.passive_recorder --screenshots

Output files are saved to data/trajectories/passive_trajectories_*.json and
automatically merged with existing trajectory data during training.
